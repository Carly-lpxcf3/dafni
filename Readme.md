# Notes for C84DAN - Data analysis for Neuroimaging

## Summary

These are the materials for a *data analysis for neuroimaging* module.

In the class, we acquire functional MRI data sets (in small groups) and use a combination of tools to analyse the data.

The module is for *10 credits* and runs for seven 2h sessions. (First iteration of the course Feb. 2017).
