# Notes for C84DAN - Data analysis for Neuroimaging

## Summary

These are the materials for a *data analysis for neuroimaging* module.

In the class, we acquire functional MRI data sets (in small groups) and use a combination of tools to analyse the data.

The module is for *10 credits* and runs for seven 2h sessions. (First iteration of the course Feb. 2017).

## Assignment

The **assignment** is a short written report:

- 250w abstract
- plus a main document max 1500w
- references / citations (don't add to the wordcount)
- max. 5 figures (which can have sub-panels, subplots)

This report should summarise the methods and results from the analysis. Effort and attention to detail should be weighted towards a clearly written abstract (250w), methods, results and discussions. Only a brief Introduction is required.
