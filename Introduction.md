## What's the plan?

1. Acquire some functional MRI data in a simple, but real experiment
2. Analyze the data with ``fsl`` [(FMRIB webpage)](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki)
3. Learn a bit about ``UNIX`` and version control
4. Use ``Matlab`` to inspect and visualise some data

## Setting up computers


---

## FSL analysis

- point & click version (like some of you have already done)
- digging into the details of how this is implemented
- inspecting analysis output, intermediate files, ...
---

## Some UNIX

- only basics are needed for running FSL analysis
- helpful for organising (any) research data
- pointer to more complex things (e.g. ``freesurfer``)

```bash
# navigate file system
# cd, ls, pwd, which, ...

# clone a repository
git clone
```


---

## Version control ``git``

- principles of using version control (``git``)
- create (free) github id and start working on a simple project
