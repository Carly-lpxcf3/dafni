# Introduction

## What's the plan?

## Setting up computers

## FSL analysis

- point & click version (like some of you have already done)
- digging into the details of how this is implemented
- inspecting analysis output, intermediate files, ...

## Some UNIX

- only basics are needed for running FSL analysis
- helpful for organising (any) research data
- using version control (``git``)
- pointer to more complex things (e.g. ``freesurfer``)
