# Brain images in Matlab

The aims of this lesson are:

  - refresh your memory about ``matlab``
  - see how to load ``nifti`` images (pre-2017b we need a toolbox, [now support is native](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/niftiread.html)). See the first exercise below.
  - we build a simple ``makeMontage()`` function for displaying 3d imaging data. **Plan out / design / write** ``makeMontage()``
  - thinking about putting your code under version control!

Look at the files and exercises in the [matlab_images folder](./matlab_images/Readme.md).
