# Manipulating text, notes and other data in Matlab

## Session aims

The aims of this lesson are:

  - use ``curl`` to download some data from a website  (no browser, terminal)
  - (check out the ``matlab`` equivalent(s): ``webread()`` and ``websave()`` )
  - inspect file in ``bash/terminal`` and then load into ``matlab``

>Given a ``nifti`` data set (4d FMRI data), and a mystery timecourse (1d), find the spatial location of the signal (x,y,z) coordinates

*In groups of 3-5*

Look at the files and exercises in the [matlab_ text folder](./matlab_text/Readme.md) for more details.
