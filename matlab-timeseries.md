# Looking at time series - linear regression reprise

The aims of this lesson are:

  - show solution / approach for retro-fitting ``sliceview()`` program (last time)
  - load in a text file that represents the design matrix ``X`` (as made by fsl/FEAT)
  - load in 4d image (nifti) and select out a particular voxel's timecourse
  - write the code that will to the *linear regression*  
  - **(if time / for after class)** look at how *t-stat* can be calculated, given residuals, design matrix and contrast vector.

*We will be working on a script.*

Look at the files and exercises in the [matlab_timeseries folder](./matlab_timeseries/Readme.md).
