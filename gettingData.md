# Getting Data

## Data acquisition in the scanner

1. T1w-MPRAGE: to illustrate detailed (1mm isotropic) anatomy
2. field map: to show that B0 can be measured
3. fMRI experiment (block): TR 2s, TE 40ms, 240s
4. fMRI experiment (event-related): same scanning parameters.
5. [additional, if time permits] EPI data (test): 5 echoes at different TEs to illustrate T2* decay


## Materials for stimuli:

We will provide the stimulus code (written in Matlab / MGL) in line with what happened in - [Learning Matlab / C84NIM](https://github.com/schluppeck/learningMatlab) - a pre-requisite for this course.

We'll run a "Faces versus houses / scenes localiser, as this works well and is a very robust experiment.
